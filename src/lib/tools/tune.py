    # NOTE

    # `n_workers` defines the number of processes ("workers") that will be evaluating
    # Optuna trials in parallel, which can significantly accelerate the tuning.
    # Carefully read this comment, in particular the "Limitations" paragraph,
    # before using this option.
    #
    # **General notes**
    #
    # - Lightweight workloads (e.g. tuning a plain MLP) that underutilize GPU can
    #   benefit from `n_workers > 1` even when all workers are running on the same GPU.
    #   Heavy workloads that fully utilize GPU can still benefit from `n_workers > 1`
    #   by running each worker on a separate GPU (see the next point).
    #
    # - To use multiple GPUs, set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable
    #   accordingly. For example, when `n_workers=4` and the command is as follows:
    #   ```
    #   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1" uv run bin/tune.py path/to/exp
    #   ```
    #   then two workers will run with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0"`,
    #   and two workers will run with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="1"`.
    #
    # **Practical tips**
    #
    # - Ensure that the machine has at least `n_workers + 1` CPU cores.
    # - For a plain MLP on A100, `n_workers=3` is a good starting point,
    #   i.e. it is faster then `n_workers=2` and comparable with `n_workers=4`.
    # - The execution time scales well with the number of GPUs, i.e. using
    #   N GPUs instead of 1 will reduce the tuning time almost by the factor of N.
    #
    # **Limitations**
    #
    # - Setting `n_workers > 4` can hurt the tuning results performance. Currently,
    #   there is no single explanation for why this happens. One hypothesis is that
    #   the multi-process tuning trajectory "lags" behind the single-process one,
    #   and the lag increases with the number of workers.
    # - When `n_workers` is used, bitwise reproducibility is not possible anymore.
    # - When `n_workers` is used, interrupting the tuning and resuming it from a
    #   checkpoint affects the optimization trajectory. For example, in the edge case
    #   of interrupting and resuming the run after each trial, the tuning behaves
    #   as there is only one worker.
    # - The workers are not allowed to spawn new processes. That in particular means
    #   that `torch.utils.data.DataLoader(..., num_workers > 0)` will lead to an error.
    #
    # P.S. One more technical thing to keep in mind. In `optuna.samplers.TPESampler`,
    # the argument `n_startup_trials` defines the number of _completed and pruned_
    # trials before activating the TPE algorithm, i.e. running trials are _not_ taken
    # into account. For example, `n_workers=32` and `n_startup_trials=20` will lead to
    # 32 random trials followed by 19 more (51 in total) random trials before starting
    # the TPE phase (modulo edge cases when workers finish trials simultaneously).

    # NOTE
    # The study optimization loop roughly looks as follows:
    #
    # 1. Create a trial. Mark its state as "running" and add to the study storage.
    # 2. Call the objective function. The objective function is allowed to modify
    #    the trial object, e.g. by setting user attributes.
    # 3. Finalize all the trial data in the study storage.
    # 4. Call the callbacks with a read-only view of the trial.
    #
    # In the _single-process_ setup, a list of trial statuses in the study storage
    # usually looks like this:
    #
    # [COMPLETE, COMPLETE, ..., COMPLETE, <RUNNING OR COMPLETE>]
    #  ID=0      ID=1           ID=N      ID=N+1
    #
    # The above means that the order of trial IDs (`trial.number`) follows the order
    # in which the trials are completed. By contrast, in the _multi-process_ setup,
    # the following is possible (note that the trial N+1 is already completed,
    # while the trial N is still running):
    #
    # [COMPLETE, COMPLETE, ..., RUNNING, COMPLETE, ...]
    #  ID=0      ID=1           ID=N     ID=N+1
    #
    # From the "algorithmic" perspective, the order of completion is more important
    # (e.g. for analyzing how the best score evolves during the optimization process).
    # This is why there is the `completed_trial_ids` list in the checkpoint storing
    # the trials IDs in the order of completion, which is used, for example,
    # in `_filter_trials`.
